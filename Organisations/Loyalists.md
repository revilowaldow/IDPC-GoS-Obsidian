The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of [[Keoland]], loyal to [[King Kimbertos Skotti]]. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region. The [[town guard]], the [[dwarves]], and the local farmers are generally loyalists.

The loyalists care about security. They want to keep [[Keoland]]'s enemies at bay while ensuring law and order. They see smuggling as a key problem, as it enriches the [[Sea Princes]] at the cost of the royal treasury and the efforts of honest merchants.

Above all else, the members of this faction put their faith in law. They exert influence through the town guard, though they remain within their legal authority.

At their best, the loyalists want to grow [[Saltmarsh]] into a trading hub with a higher standard of living and improved security. If the [[Sea Princes]] are held in check and the sea lanes cleared of threats, [[Saltmarsh]] can grow to become the envy of the world.

At their worst, the loyalists see the people of [[Saltmarsh]] as a barrier to growth. The locals are little more than allies of the [[Sea Princes]], traitors who for too long have evaded the crown's notice. If they were to do as the loyalists tell them, then perhaps thisÂ fish-reeking pile of a town could become something respectable.
