### The Scarlet Brotherhood in Play

The Scarlet Brotherhood is an opportunistic faction. It seeks to cause the maximum amount of disruption with the least amount of risk.

The Brotherhood wants to tilt the town council in its favor and install [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] as the most prominent member. Their first goal is to find evidence of [[Gellan Primewater]]'s involvement with the [[Sea Princes]] and implicate his participation in the slave trade. Such evidence is not hard to find once [[Gellan]]'s dealings with the [[Sea Princes]] are revealed.

The Brotherhood plans to use such accusations to increase tension in town between the [[traditionalists]] and the [[loyalists]], ignite a civil war, assassinate leaders on both sides, and then use Anders as a peacemaker. Then the Brotherhood plans to assassinate [[Anders]], frame the [[Sea Princes]], and install [[Skerrin]] as his replacement as the town's foremost leader. Finally, [[Skerrin]] will agitate for war and continue to help Brotherhood agents infiltrate [[Keoland]]'s towns in the south.

If war does erupt, Brotherhood agents will work to ensure a long, drawn-out stalemate that grinds down both sides. Ideally, assassinations will pave the way for Brotherhood agents to assume high positions in both realms, but if necessary, the Brotherhood will engage armies of mercenaries, humanoid tribes, and fanatics it has gathered to finish the job. They hope that the [[Sea Princes]] can then be transformed into a puppet state, allowing the Brotherhood to turn their attention to the rest of [[Keoland]].
