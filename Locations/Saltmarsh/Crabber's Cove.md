Just east of the docks, built along the shores of a secluded bay, are a handful of buildings known collectively as Crabber's Cove. The buildings are weathered, abandoned by the residents of Saltmarsh years ago. Since then, thousands of crabs have taken up residence in the crumbling remains. Crabbers from Saltmarsh are cautious about the cove, as more than one overeager fisher has disappeared into the clacking darkness, never to be seen again. Unknown to the folk of [[Saltmarsh]], aÂ vampire named [[Xolec]] is trapped in a hidden cellar beneath one of the old cabins. [[Xolec]] was buried in an ancient tomb, unleashed on Saltmarsh decades ago when his sealed coffin was brought to town by a trader and opened. A cleric of [[St Cuthbert]] confronted him, but she wasn't able to destroy him. Instead, she trapped him here by means of a powerful curse: [[Xolec]] can leave the cellar only if someone pure of heart carries him from it.

[[Xolec]] is best left trapped, except for one detail: by a stroke of fate, agents of the [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] use the cabin above him for clandestine meetings. He knows the full details of their operation and [[Skerrin]]'s role in it. He trades this information for his freedom if confronted by adventurers.
