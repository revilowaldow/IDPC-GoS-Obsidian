Burle is a fortified outpost that is always on guard for monsters emerging from the [[Dreadwood]]. It serves as a key stopover point for travelers venturing inland from the southern coastal region. The community is dominated by a small keep set atop a hill that overlooks the forest it borders. A few farms cluster around it, the locals relying on the royal garrison to keep them safe from marauders.

Burle's most distinctive feature is the small copse of trees that grows in the middle of the keep. An ancient  treant named [[Wander Root]] dwells in the keep and acts as an informal ambassador between the humans of [[Keoland]] and the wood elves and good-aligned fey of the [[Dreadwood]]. Years ago, the knights of [[Keoland]] helped the denizens of the forest defeat an incursion by cultists worshiping elemental evil fire. Since then, the elves, the treants, and the crown of [[Keoland]] have observed the [[Wild Flame Pact]]—a treaty that calls for mutual defense against the [[Dreadwood]]'s horrors.

The outpost is commanded by its castellan, [[Kiara Shadowbreaker]] (LG female half-elf  knight), who has led many successful raids into the [[Dreadwood]]. [[Kiara Shadowbreaker|Kiara]] is a grim figure, always cognizant of the threat posed by the forest's denizens. She sees trouble behind every piece of news, and she keeps the warriors and rangers headquartered here ready to fight at a moment's notice. She is especially keen to hear news about the [[Scarlet Brotherhood|Scarlet Brotherhood]]. [[Kiara Shadowbreaker|Kiara]] is convinced that the organization poses a dire threat to the region but has failed to uncover concrete evidence of its meddling. She suspects that [[Duke Marik Feldren]] of [[Seaton]] has been compromised by [[Scarlet Brotherhood|Scarlet Brotherhood]] agents, and she surreptitiously seeks to hire spies who could investigate him in search of proof.

Burle provides a safe resting place before and during expeditions into the [[Hool Marshes]] or the [[Dreadwood]]. [[Kiara Shadowbreaker|Kiara]] offers a bounty equal to 5 gp per Hit Die for any aberration, elemental, or outlaw slain in the region. She keeps a bounty board just outside Burle's gates, which occasionally offers larger rewards for the capture or killing of specific monsters or criminals.
