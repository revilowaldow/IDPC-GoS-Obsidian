## Origin:
Kairon is from an ancient draconic bloodline that produces a sorcerer once every generation. The family have been cursed with the Tiefling appearance since the ancient beast entered the bloodline and little is known of the family tree beforehand. The Dragon is known as “The Tempest”, an enormous green dragon that torched village after village in the north searching for magical items and caused titanic storms of fire when towns or villages were spent. One day the beast left the north and was not seen again. Some say he fell victim of one of his many hoarded magical items and was killed, others say he ventured far away, looking for a legendary item that would make him unstoppable.

## Family:
Kairon has only been told pieces of his family’s history. He lived in the town of New Aeria where his family were forced to live in the slums due to their appearance. His family tried to earn an honest living but did have to trade spice on accession and sometimes rob the more fortunate. His kind were looked down upon. Despite this, Kairon and his only brother lead a pretty comfortable life thanks to the very hard work of his parents. The town was renowned for producing some of the finest wizards around and had an extremely good magical school. His parents had told him he must never go there as it would be dangerous for a Tiefling, especially if the wizards knew their family history. Despite this, his parents would often bring back books when they returned from one of their “jobs” and Kairon would get to read them before they were sold for food. Many of them were arcane in nature and Kairon found them fascinating.

Kairon was obsessed with gaining knowledge and was determined to make a life for himself out of the shadows. Maybe even become a wizard and do some good for Tieflings in society. His brother was much less interested, instead his brother chose to follow in his parents footsteps and when he was old enough, he started working alongside his parents.

## Magic:
One night, his parents sent his brother Ekemon on a simple job into the Town centre. Kairon was nearing adulthood himself and had gained quite the knowledge on arcane law but was still forbidden to go near the wizards school. He was reading a book before drifting off to sleep. That night, Kairon had a dream. He dreamt of an enormous storm with fire falling from the sky with an enormous dragon at its centre. Kairon’s heart raced as the Dragon’s head slowly turned towards him. When the beats gaze finally met Kairon’s, everything went black. Kairon could see nothing but then, a terrifying voice boomed around him from all directions. The voice said

>“I see you boy. The most recent in a long line of sorcerers born from my blood. You will be powerful yes. And I will find you. I have been looking for something for a long time. You might just be the key. Lets hope you succeed where others have failed. I will be watching.”

Then everything went white and Kairon opened his eyes. His home was on fire and he himself was on fire. He screamed and tried to put himself out but he couldn’t, and for some reason he wasn’t in any pain. He could hear panicked voices outside. He leapt to his feet and stormed into his parents room. To his horror, they were black and motionless in their beds, flames engulfing them. He cried out and ran from the house. He could see dozens of figures with glowing hands running towards the scene – wizards. He knew he had to flee when many things happened all at once. There seemed to be thunder erupting from every corner of the sky, there was a strange smell of sulphur in the air, winds were swirling in every direction, ravens were crying from the nearby woods, the doors to everyone’s houses were swinging open and shut and the lanterns that lit the streets all went out. He looked up at the approaching wizards who had slowed, obviously confused by everything that was happening but still moving towards him. Then the strangest thing happened. Objects of all shapes and sized appeared and started whizzing about the sky and towards the wizards. Clocks, chairs, glasses, swords, everything you could think of. Kairon took this opportunity to escape into the forest. When he was sure he couldn’t be found he camped under the roots of a very large tree in the forest. He was so confused, what had happened? Did he cause all that? Did he kill his parents? Where was his brother? Did the dream have anything to do with all this? What was he going to do now?

## Of Malc and Men:

After the events where Kairon discovered his magical gift, he spent years on the run moving from city to city. Living in the shadows. Trying not to draw attention. He spent years visiting libraries, trying to find magical books that even shopkeepers did not know where there. Trying to find answers to the source of his power and more importantly, try and evade the threats of the Dragon that entered his nightmare that fateful night. Eventually, he entered a tavern where he overheard a group of adventurers talking about their various quests. Before long, a brawl broke out after one of the members tried to swindle a local in a game of dice. Kairon used his gifts to cause numerous distractions like blowing the door open and causing the ground to shake. This gave the group a chance to slip out unnoticed. Around an hour later, Kairon left the tavern but was confronted by a man with a lute. He skipeed over to Kairon playing his instrument and whispered in his ear.

>“We know what you did for us, if you want work, visit the inn just outside of town”.

Kairon visited the inn and the group announced themselves as Of Malc and Men and offered him a place with them. They needed someone with his abilities with an upcoming adventure. Kairon accepted but was not ready to divulge his secrets to them…..yet.
