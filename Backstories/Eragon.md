### Oath of Glory Paladin
#### Actions over Words. 
Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.

#### Challenges Are but Tests. 
Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.

#### Hone the Body. 
Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.

#### Discipline the Soul. 
You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.
