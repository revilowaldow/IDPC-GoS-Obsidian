Gerhard von Schineiffer grew far inland from Saltmarsh, in the capital of Niole Dra. He grew up with a talent for music and performance, often attending performances in the local taverns and keeping abreast of the latest stars of the lute and bagpipes as they travelled through Keoland. All of the most ambitious musicians would eventually venture to the capital. Gerhard joined a company of minstrels, The Most Excellent Party of Loutists, who caught his ear with their northern style of music. The company travelled far and wide within Keoland. The company was poor however, and often beset by difficult conditions and robbed by bandits along the dangerous routes of southern Keoland.

Gerhard had to get smart, and quickly. Often the difference between robbery and murder would be a well placed word or the expression on a musicians face. Gerhard quickly learned when to lean on his powers of persuasion and when he knew he could terrify a potential opponent.

The group was captured by pirates while travelling along the southern coast road. The party had been drawn in by promise of money for performance at a local tavern, before the doors were locked and the group were bound. They were dragged away to a waiting ship, which set sail for the south.

The ship made landfall early in the morning, and Gerhard was dragged from the hold ashore. He was led through winding streets to a cavernous building. This was the arena, where poor, destitute souls fought for survival. Gerhard spent months here, losing and just about not losing, but never quite winning. The cries from the crowd were in a foreign tongue, but were obviously aggressive and unfriendly. The spectators seemed grizzled and rough, as if they had suffered and fought almost as much as the gladiators. The sun beat down on the arena. Gerhard knew he had to escape. No fighter made it more than a year here.

Gerhard devised a plan. The guards spoke common, and he knew he could escape if he could only disguise himself. The audience looked so battered he could blend in even as a fighter. Gerhard cobbled together a disguise kit from the belongings of fighters who lost badly over a few weeks. Dressing as a pirate, and shaving his beard, he slipped into the crowd after a fight.

The guards knew a fighter was missing, but they also knew the futility of searching a place as lawless as this. Gerhard made for the docks, learning on his short journey that this was the hold of the sea princes, a lawless land full of roving gangs of pirates and a constantly shifting political landscape. Some merchants from Saltmarsh and Seaton plied routes from the Hold, seeking freedom from the excises and duties charged in Keoland. Gerhard made a rush for one of these ships, the golden figurehead of a merchant ship calling out to him. He made a deal with the captain, safe passage to Keoland and Gerhard would perform for the crew each night.

The ship made landfall in Saltmarsh. Gerhard set himself up as a performer in a local tavern, earning his keep and trying to forget about his time as a fighter in the Hold. It was here at the tavern he met the rest of Malc and Men, and determined to get revenge.
