# Auberon

Was born into an elvish clan of self-trained rogues that travelled throughout the lands (kind of like gypsys) as they’d been cast away from their homelands due to humans. I grew up with a deep hatred of humans because of this. Something that deepened my hatred of them was that the elf that trained me to be a rogue was killed by a human in a racist attack (Auberon’s age can be assumed to be between 10-20 years old when this happened) as we passed outside one of the many towns humans now inhabited. They’d gotten wind of our clan’s movements and set up an ambush as we were passing through. Although (due to assumed death of old age) I cannot kill the human that ended my mentor’s life, I wish to find the town that ambushed my clan and locate (and kill) any descendants that may still reside there (and also just generally wreak havoc around the town until it meets its end).

At the age of 110 (currently 130ish), I broke away from the clan to begin fending for myself and searching for information on the town that killed my mentor. It was during this time I bumped into Nix and Kairon (can be whomever you want tbf, as in the whole party, but wanted it to seem reasonable age wise) and began adventuring with them.

Having to survive at all costs with my old elven clan has honed my sense of trying to get as much money/wealth from people as possible regardless of how much they have (I literally care if they’re poor or rich, just want to take whatever I can in order to survive/become more powerful).

Ok interesting, quite a violent end goal. Especially one that hasn't dimmed over 100 years of holding a grudge. I'm fine with a revenge arc but would prefer to avoid turning the game into "NPC slaughter simulator" if you find the village. A limited group of descendants would probably be fine, a whole village would be a bit much. It's worth considering in advance how you think the other characters may react to that desire.

Maybe exploring the world without the rest of your clan will give you a novel perspective you haven't had over the last 100 years. When you broke away from your clan did you do so amicably? What standing were you in when you left, a senior and respected member? Maybe a younger hot-headed one? Are there any individuals still in the clan you're close to? Family, friends? Consider using [https://noads.5e.tools/lifegen.html](https://noads.5e.tools/lifegen.html) to fill in some gaps?

Maybe a little inspired by The Witcher?

Will be able to work some aspects of the backstory into the game. I will think a little more on the current human/elf relations and how that works out.

There's already been a few indicators of Elven oppression in your explorations of Saltmarsh though you may not have noticed them...

Yeah that’s a good point, would definitely be keen to have that arc but maybe let’s just narrow it down to like 1/2 descendants rather than the whole village. Would definitely say I left the clan amicably, and as more of a respected member as I had to step up at a younger age because some of the older elves were killed in the ambush. Will have a look at the link you’ve sent now and see if I can fill in a few more gaps - will definitely look for some Witcher inspo as well.

I'll have a think about some descendants, a town and an elven clan then!

Spotted the bridge as a symbol of oppression
