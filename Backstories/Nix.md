Nix’s story starts not from tragedy, but from ambition and thirst for knowledge. His early years were spent amongst a warm, loyal and caring family, who were integral to their local town community. The mountain dwarves of Cipherus lived happily and quietly in a secluded network of caves and mountainous plateaus across the hilltops of the Cipher mountains. These were generally incredibly inhospitable lands, so rarely did they receive visitors of other races and creeds.

Cipherus as a town was a size of roughly 750 mountain dwarves. Small enough that it had a strong sense of community, and it was rare to see someone you did not know, but large enough to be self sufficient, have a functioning economy and a good range of jobs and heritage to be an established town in their own right. Cipherus dwarves are famed throughout much of the land for two main reasons.

First is the fact that they run and operate the mines that provide fuel to most of the major norther cities. The Cipher mountains have a core of coal so pure and dense legend has it a pound of cipher coal can stay lit for a thousand days. Many in the town believe that the mountains are holy, and that the gods themselves have imbued the coal here with magical properties, making it so efficient and high quality. Some of course however, believe this is rubbish, and that it is simply evolution that after many generations of trial mining and finally finding a high quality product have people decided to settle here. The main elements of religion in Cipherus revolve around respect - not necessarily worship - for the land and the environment around them. Their religion primarily focuses upon a mutual respect for the land, forever being thankful for what it provides.

As part of this, many Cipherus are vegetarian, living off what the mountains naturally provide, such as wild berries, breads made of mountain wheats and other loosely farmed foods. They find it is more in balance to take what is offered than disrupt the natural order of things and seek to kill or over cultivate. (Meta note: I’d say their religion is mostly akin to a blend of Shinto and Buddhism in the way they practice).

The second reason the Cipherus peoples are known so widely are their skill at the forge. Cipherus blacksmiths  make use of the incredibly fertile coal - which they call ‘heart of the mountain’ - to produce forges that are unmatched in their ability to control and regulate temperature. They can get blisteringly hot, but the most impressive part is the way the Cipherus blacksmiths have learnt to control the heat of thr forge, having degree precision at all times. This leads to impeccable quality in their produced goods, both in smelting pure ingots or weapons. Many a time noblemen and royalty will request the use of a Cipherus forge when they have a job to be done.

Those who have stayed in Cipherus have a range of jobs, fulfilling all the roles of a medium sized town, however many are dominated by the miners of the mountains. This is a role that is seen within the town as a role of honour, and it is the wish of many for their lineage to continue as miners. Those however who have moved away from the town most commonly find work as a blacksmith, as many hear of their skill and precision at the forge, which they are only too happy to demonstrate.

When Nix was younger, he was given a different name by birth, but that has since been shed as part of his monastic initiation. He grew up in the town, with friends, family and townsfolk all living harmoniously. His mother baked in the local bakery, feeding the miners and delivering to the local pubs and taverns. His father was a miner.. a humble, modest but incredibly skilled worker. He worked hard, and with a great attention to detail, always taking the time to tirelessly clean his tools at the end of every day and inspect the smallest of fissures that appeared in the mines each day.

Nix took after his father in this, developing a keen eye for detail and honest work ethic. He worked for the first 40 years alongside his kin in the mines, proud of his contribution to the wider world. In his spare time he would spend evenings with his friends learning the forges, crafting all sorts of useless trinkets and odd items such as coat hooks or filigree for the neighbours garden gate.

However he had always wanted more. Nix had an intense desire to learn, to question and contemplate. He loved what he did but it didn’t satisfy his hunger for knowledge. He wanted to see the world. Whenever a rare visitor would visit Cipherus they were often an envoy of a royal requesting the services of their forges, clad in fine silks and fabrics. These were things Nix had never seen before, and his imagination ran away every time with the thought of what else was out there. He’d often sit atop a ridge looking out wondering how far he could go, with the kingdoms spread beneath him, he wanted to see it all.

It was fate that one day a curious traveller stumbled into town. Modestly dressed and carrying little more than a staff and provisions, it was the gold cylinder that caught nix’s curiosity the most. It was a telescope, for the traveller was a cartographer, on a journey to map out the outer reaches of the kingdoms. He had travelled to Cipherus on his journey to plot and record its existence in his latest maps.

Nix got talking to the traveller, and when he explained his job involved roaming the world, observing and recording what he found, nix couldn’t believe such an life could exist. He brought the traveller to his family, whom he stayed with for the next few weeks. They became good friends, with the traveller expressing wild stories and tales of far away lands chosen by nix as he pointed out odd looking places on the travellers maps. He exchanged these stories and help with chores for his lodgings and feed.

Nix convinced his family that this was what he needed to do, and in trusting the traveller, he finally said goodbye to his home in the mountains and left with the traveller on his journey. The traveller was happy to have company through these remote areas, and nix was desperate to learn every step of the way.

They walked for many miles, charting territory and living off the land as they went. On their journey the traveller revealed to Nix that he was a monk. It was the only reason he was able to live so nomadically and fulfil his life on the road, meeting new people and experiencing new cultures. His primary clients were wealthy merchants, who sought out detailed maps for trade routes and business opportunities. Nix became fascinated with the way of the monk, and the balance of nature he had developed. The traveller however eventually delivered some heavy news for Nix. For the time being his adventures would come to an end temporarily, as he had rented a studio in a nearby city where he would base himself for the next several months through the winter as he plotted and drafted the routes onto his maps.

Saddened but not deterred from this sense of adventure, the monk told him of a place he could continue to develop his thirst for knowledge of the world, and satisfy his desire for adventure. He told him of a monastery/university where monks would live and work not as religious peoples, but academics, pondering philosophy, anthropology and the world of epistemology as a whole. They were thinkers, who often sat in meditation, but were able to channel a special energy called ki to balance their body and mind.

Curious to explore this way of life, Nix left the traveller in his new studio after helping him buy some vellum, quills and candles in the royal port city of Noved, and set out to find the university.

Nix followed the cartographers directions with meticulous precision, traveling for days at a time to make his progress. He finally arrived at the walled gates of the Bacosep university during a blizzard. The university stood high in a mountain, built in a natural enclave in the side of a ridge. The high altitude offered quiet, peace and clarity of mind. Perfect conditions for contemplating the most existential of questions.

As Nix arrived at the gates, snow had laid thickly around the stone walls and gates. A single figure walked slowly and silently, most noteably barefoot, from the central door across the courtyard to greet Nix. He took him, looked him in the eye and said only two words. ‘Nix Alba’. He would later come to find this meant ‘white snow’ in an ancient and most advanced of languages. (Meta note: it’s Latin if you were wondering.. also, Finnerty is Celtic for white snow, so a bit of genealogy there) this was due to the unusually heavy snowstorm that Nix had seen to have brought with him on an otherwise warm and sunny October.

From there, Nix studied the way of mercy, learning to become balanced with nature, learning to channel ki to help where possible and refining the ability to harm when required. He learnt that all things come in balance, and where there is help there is harm and so on. In the Bacosep university, the most prevailing school of throughly is that through the greater mastery of ki shows an affinity of balance with the world between being and nature. Only through this attunement can one strive for enlightenment.

As part of his development, Nix took leave from the university walls, now competent in basic monk skills and headed back to the port of Noved, to find his traveller companion. He found him, and overjoyed at their reunion after what had been a long and unusually harsh winter, they drank long into the night at a local tavern, where the cartographer told Nix a secret that would change the course of his life forever.

The cartographer, after having drank far too much spilled a great secret. He was not solely out plotting landmarks when he had first encountered Nix, but he had discovered a legend of an object that could channel a wearers pure energy into ki. The legend was of an amulet, long lost that would enable the wearer pure enlightenment, essentially making them an oracle. Legend has it that many of these oracles were driven mad by the power the amulet possessed, and in their own greed for knowledge and power it would consume them, until one day the council of elder monks gathered and split the stone, with each fragment to be hidden in the deepest depths of the kindgoms.

Each of these fragments still holds great power, and should they ever be reunified could provide a tool for absolute progress and development, if it can be properly harnessed. The traveller you see, was out to find one of these fragments. It is not known how many of these fragments have been found, but it is common knowledge that there are 5 in existence. Those who wield one do not shout about these, for they are highly legendary, and those who know how to use them are far smarter than to boast about their possession. The traveller had been studying a collection of old maps that fell into his possession when he discovered the potential location of one of these fragments marked on one of these maps. He took leave immediately in search of this great treasure.

Nix was amazed by this story, and his head was flooded with ideas and stories. He committed to his traveller friend then and there that he would find the fragments, and that he would use them to restore balance in the world by finding and returning them to his university for study and safe keeping. His mission was clear now, this was his destiny. He was to find the five fragments and return them to where they belong, back to the university.

He talked with the traveller at length over the next few days, and together they formulated a plan. The most accessible place to explore and the strongest lead was off the coast of Saltmarsh, a small fishing village to the east. It was a temperate area, with a small community and deep heritage. Nix travelled there in only a matter of days from where he was, hitching a ride with a local merchant, who was headed there in time for the weekly market on Tuesdays.

He talked to the merchant who told Nix he should lodge in the Snapping Line. A dwarf himself, he though Nix would be out of place drinking with the rest of the dwarves in Saltmarsh south of the river, as he wasn’t in the usual sooty miners clothes or heavy chain mail garb, and as a piece of advice for his own sake should stay north of the river for his own sake if he wanted to avoid weird looks or uncomfortable questions. It had been so long Nix had forgotten completely that his monks robes were not common clothing choices across the lands, especially for a dwarf. Still, heeding the advice of the merchant he hopped off the cart at the Snapping Line, rented a room and sat down to drink quietly in the corner. He had planned to drink quietly by himself that night, ready to explore any leads early in the morning, however his interest was piqued by a group of loutish travellers at the next table. A trio of outcasts, a teifling, a dragon born and a rogue of some description sat, drunk and singing along to a bard that was dancing and skipping on the tabletop in front of them.

Nix watched them with glee, laughing at their antics, spilling ale over each other and the hard occasionally tripping over a tankard and falling flat onto the floor. Eventually the four started talking of adventures, telling of riches and travels. It was drunk talk, but Nix was a sucker for adventure. Enamoured with dreams of travel and exploration, he wandered over to the table and sat down. In their intoxicated state, the group embraced Nix, another drinking companion. They shared stories into the night and eventually one of the group took out of his pocket a small piece of parchment to blow his nose into. They all asked what it was, before realising it was a notice from the towns notice board asking for assistance in return for coin. The promise of coin enticed the group immediately, as this meant more money for ale! Nix, planning to stay in Saltmarsh for some time anyway thought to himself, and decided it could only help to gather leads on a fragment of the amulet and he had no better place to start. He was in.
