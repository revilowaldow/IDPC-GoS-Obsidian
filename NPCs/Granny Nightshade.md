One of the [[Dreadwood]]'s most powerful denizens is a truly ancient night hag named Granny Nightshade, who dwells in the deepest depths of the forest. She commands magic as well as a mighty wizard does and has struck bargains with several dukes of the [[Nine Hells]]. Her twisted fortress, [[Castle Spiral]], stands at the nexus point between the [[Shadowfell]] and Oerth, and from its gates emerge skeletons, zombies, shadows, and other horrors to threaten the land.

Granny Nightshade counts [[jackalweres]] as her foremost minions, and she has also acquired the services of goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, ogres, and trolls over the years. [[Green hags]] bound to her service act as baronesses who enforce her will over their section of the forest, and an [[elite guard of twenty-three oni]] acts as her personal messengers and enforcers. She keeps [[three consorts]], powerful vampires that struggle among themselves for her favor.

### **Dark Dreams.** 
Taking a long rest anywhere in the Dreadwood carries with it the risk of drawing Granny Nightshade's attention. Each resting character must roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the character suffers horrible dreams that leave them marked by the forest. Creatures of the Dreadwood gain advantage on all attacks against them for the next day and know the character's name and personal details, calling to them to journey deeper into the forest and serve beside their mistress.
