[[Skerrin Wavechaser|Skerrin]] was renowned for his patience during his days as an assassin for the [[Brotherhood]]. Once, he hid himself in the attic above a noble's bedroom, waiting in a trance-like state for three days and nights until his target was positioned just below a small crack in the room's ceiling. Skerrin squeezed a single drop from a vial of poison he carried on to the noble's bald scalp. He waited in his hiding place for another full day until the contact poison killed the man.
