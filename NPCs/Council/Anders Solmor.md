Young Anders (LG male human  noble) recently inherited his family's fleet of fishing boats after the untimely death of his mother, [[Petra Solmor|Petra]]. He's the youngest person ever to be elected to the council. Brash and inexperienced, Anders is a slight man with sharp features and a toothy smile. His recent forays into trade have made him a local celebrity. Since Anders owns both a fishing fleet and several trading vessels, he can sell his catch at a highly competitive price. And he can offer better prices for the other fishers in town to sell to him, since his catch brings in so much more profit.

Everyone involved in the town's fishing industry supports Anders, and his energy and ambition have made him something of a folk hero on the docks. On the other hand, his open opposition to smuggling and his hatred of the Sea Princes' practice of slavery makes him a thorn in the smugglers' side.

Unbeknownst to Anders, his butler, [[Skerrin Wavechaser]], is an agent for the [[Scarlet Brotherhood]]. He engineered the death of [[Anders Solmor|Anders]]' mother and has placed a number of [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] agents in key positions in the Solmor fleet.

#### Personality Traits. 
Anders is sunny and optimistic. He sees the potential for profit and opportunity in every challenge. Unfortunately, he is too young to temper his views with a realistic assessment of the risks.

#### Ideal. 
Anders believes that freedom is the root of happiness. He pays his employees well and wants to help [[Saltmarsh]] grow into a prosperous town. Above all else, he hates the [[Sea Princes]] and wants to see their realm and its slave trade scoured from the earth.

#### Bond. 
Anders's mother [[Petra Solmor]] was the center of his life, and his sense of responsibility stems from her example. Every important decision he makes is guided by his desire to live up to her standards. If [[Skerrin Wavechaser|Skerrin]] is implicated in her murder, his hold over Anders would be shattered. For now, [[Skerrin Wavechaser|Skerrin]] uses [[Petra Solmor|Petra]]'s memory to fan Anders's antipathy toward the [[Sea Princes]].

#### Flaw. 
Due to a combination of his youth and his somewhat sheltered upbringing, Anders is naïve. He relied on his mother's expertise in most matters, which has allowed [[Skerrin Wavechaser|Skerrin]] to worm his way into Anders's confidence.
