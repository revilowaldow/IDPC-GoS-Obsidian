# Winston

Located in [[Saltmarsh Village]]
Uses 

The owner of this establishment, a retired rogue, knows a great deal about the Hool Marshes. Winston (N male halflingÂ [bandit](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#bandit_mm)) spent years as an outlaw lurking in the marshes before a raid on an army payroll caravan netted him enough loot to open a business. The increased presence of law enforcement in Saltmarsh has him on edge, and he is concerned that his involvement in the heist will emerge. In the meantime, he does business with sailors, adventurers, and those who need "solid goods at honest prices," as he often says. Winston has a few maps of the marshes, and those who intend to explore that area often consult with him for guidance.
