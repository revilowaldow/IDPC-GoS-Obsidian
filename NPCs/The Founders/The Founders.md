[[Strixhaven]] University was founded by five ancient dragons who, according to legend, hatched from the magical energy of the newborn world of Arcavios. These Founder Dragons were among the first to master magic, and they realized that only through disciplined study would magic be safe in the hands of other peoples. They founded [[Strixhaven]] to facilitate that study and established the five colleges based on the magic that each dragon mastered, as summarized in the Founder Dragons table.

To this day, the Founder Dragons roam the world. They no longer associate directly with [[Strixhaven]], preferring to let the deans of the colleges speak in their stead. The dragons' knowledge is vast, but their tempers can prove short. Mages seek them out only to learn the most elusive secrets.
