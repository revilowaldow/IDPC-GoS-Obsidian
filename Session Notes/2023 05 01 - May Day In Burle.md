### Fermenter Ivmal Alef (Human, he/him)

“_Why do I ferment? Consider this: you and I may separately follow the recipe for a cake and bake two identical desserts. But if you and I follow the exact same recipe for fermented cabbage, why, no power on earth will allow these two cabbages to taste the same. To ferment is to create art. To ferment is to be individual._”
