The _Marshal_ was a seafaring vessel built by missionaries of St. Cuthbert. Their plan was to travel the world in the ship, bringing law, order, and the word of their god to every port. Three years ago the mission launched, but the _Marshal_ never made it to the first stop. Harpies serenaded the travelers, luring the vessel shoreward until it crashed into the rocks near Saltmarsh.

The _Marshal_ has the following features:

**Barnacles**. The outside of the _Marshal_ is covered in all manner of sharp barnacles. A creature that is pushed against the outside of the ship by magic like the [thunderwave](https://5e.warlow.engineer/spells.html#thunderwave_phb) spell, or by a shove attack, or that falls [prone](https://5e.warlow.engineer/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb) onto a barnacle-covered surface takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage.

**Ceilings**. The ceilings of the _Marshal_'s lower deck are 8 feet high, with 6-foot-high doorways connecting the chambers.

**Depth**. The sea floor is 40 feet below the surface of the water. The _Marshal_'s highest point is 5 feet below the surface of the water. The depth of the rocks and various decks of the ship are noted on map A.6.

**Light**. The exposed decks of the _Marshal_ and areas outside the ship are brightly lit by the sun during the day and dimly lit by the moon at night. The interior of the ship and the sea cave are concealed in darkness.

**Structure**. The wood of the _Marshal_'s hull, deck, and doors is rotting. Unless otherwise noted, a door or a 5-foot-square section of wall, ceiling, or floor of the ship has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
