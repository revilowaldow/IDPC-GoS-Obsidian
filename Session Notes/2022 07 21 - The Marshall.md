Statue of [[St Cuthbert]]


Arla & Vengi Carmaclo

## Golem Diver[

Wellgar Brinehanded wants the statue in the cargo hold ([area M3](https://5e.warlow.engineer/adventure.html#GoS,8,m3.%20cargo%20hold,0)) of the _Marshal_ because he wants to put it in the temple of procan in saltmarsh to encourage greater attendance and diversity of faith. At the same time, Arla and Vengi Carmaclo, twin mages and worshipers of Iuz, want to recover the statue for themselves as it will please their deity.

Saltmarsh Story Hook. 

Wellgar asks the characters to recover the statue from the wreck. Wellgar warns the characters that bandits might try to recover treasure from the wreck and to be on the lookout.

If the characters recover the statue but don't give it to Wellgar, he excludes them from the congregationn and they are pariahs in town.

Wizards. 

When the characters approach the wreck, they notice a keelboat, the _Bat Guano_, anchored in the distance. The boat belongs to the twins Arla and Vengi Carmaclo (LN human [mages](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#mage_mm)), devout followers of St. Cuthbert on a mission to recover the statue, which was carved by their father, Fergos. They sent their iron golem to claim the work of art so they could avoid the harpies and are waiting for the construct to return.

If the characters are polite, the wizards happily share their mission. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check convinces the mages to allow the characters to recover the statue for them. The wizards are willing to give 500 gp to the characters if they help with the recovery.

If the characters recover the statue without talking to the wizards, the mages attack the characters, demanding the statue be given to them. The mages fight until one of them falls.

Iron Golem. 

When the characters arrive at the wreck of the _Marshal_, Arla and Vengi's [iron golem](https://5e.warlow.engineer/bestiary.html#iron%20golem_mm) is in [area M3](https://5e.warlow.engineer/adventure.html#GoS,8,m3.%20cargo%20hold,0), breaking the chains that bind the statue before it attempts to lift it out of the ship. If the characters try to hinder the golem, it attacks, fighting until the characters retreat. The golem allows the characters to help it bring the statue back to the _Bat Guano_.
