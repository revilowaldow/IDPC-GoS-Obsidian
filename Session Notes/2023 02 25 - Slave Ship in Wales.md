### Plan 
Start in Burle having just long rested

Kiara gives orders to stake out Scarstone Basin. Stealthy
	Show region map and discuss plan
	Heist on Gellan's house has no benefit unless we can ensure he is away, do you have any idea what's inside?
	Assault on member of Burle's guard - unacceptable

Sending Stone
Intercept Boat after discovery
Prevent the boat from reaching Saltmarsh or Seaton
Trolls in forest outskirts if camping and watch etc

Antagonists:

Erdan & Rohan Hillhand
Dwarf brothers
Scouts/Ambushers
Trafficers

Leshanna - driven out?

Julian Breuer - Incompetent knight




Seaton:

Duke Marik Feldren
Hates smugglers vindictive

Amanda Keetes, pirate assigned to transfer the slaves
	Supported by crew of bandits and swashbukclers

Crew on slave ship from Scarstone are hobgoblins
	Faction name? [[Legion of Maglubiyet]]
	Working in alliance with Granny Nightshade
	Dreadwood
	Slaves? Gnolls? Gnomes? Jackalwere?
	Lycanthropes - wererat
	Peopel who've annoyed nightshade basically
	Some innocents
	Some miscreants
