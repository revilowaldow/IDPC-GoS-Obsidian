### Plan 
Start in Burle having just long rested

Kiara gives orders to stake out Scarstone Basin. Stealthy
	Show region map and discuss plan
	Heist on Gellan's house has no benefit unless we can ensure he is away, do you have any idea what's inside?
	Assault on member of Burle's guard - unacceptable

Sending Stone
Intercept Boat after discovery
Prevent the boat from reaching Saltmarsh or Seaton
