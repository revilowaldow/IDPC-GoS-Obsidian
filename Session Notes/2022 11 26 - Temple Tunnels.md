## Session Summary:

You chased after Winston down the tunnel, leaving Eliander behind. 
After initially catching up with Winston half of you dealt with the bearing golem he summoned, by stuffing it in a bag of holding. You caught Winston and after several attempts, bound him.

Winston bartered information with you for his freedom in exchange for the following information.


### Loyalists


## Dan C's Notes

#### Winston Interrogation

The Saltmarsh council are split into two factions, the [[Loyalists]] and the [[Traditionalists]]. The [[Loyalists]] are typically loyal to the overall kingdom ([[Keoland]] and are trying to ‘improve’ [[Saltmarsh]] (like they did with [[Seaton]]). However, this often means losing all sense of personality of a town/city. Taking [[Seaton]] as an example, the city is successful and a strong naval stronghold, but is devoid of meaningful life. The [[Loyalists]] also have good relationships with the dwarves and mines as they need the mines to be a success - [[Loyalists]] include: [[Eliander Fireborn|Eliander]], [[Manistrad Copperlocks]]
[[Eliander Fireborn]] has a writ from the [[King Kimbertos Skotti|King]] that allows him to take full command of the guards if needed. The Guards also tend to fall into the [[Loyalists|Loyalist]] camp.

[[Traditionalists]] are more interested in the personality and trade of the city and so will let smuggling go for the ‘good’ of the community (as well as being able to satiate whatever their level of greed may be). The idea being that a small amount of smuggling enhances the trade of the town and therefore the QOL of the community. It also entices a variety of personalities into the town to conduct business and so makes for a more interesting, vibrant place to inhabit. - Traditionalists include: [[Eda Oweland]], [[Gellan Primewater]] 
It should be noted that the general people of [[Saltmarsh]] are not in favour of slavery and have no desire to live under the rule of the [[Sea Princes]] but also wish to avoid a war between them and [[Keoland]]. The loyalty of the [[Traditionalists]] to their [[King Kimbertos Skotti|King]] is secondary to their desire for peace.

[[Winston]] states that [[Gellan Primewater|Primewater]] is essentially the head of the entire smuggling organisation within [[Saltmarsh]] as well as being a slaver. This is purely driven by his greed. He’s known to pay for lavish events for the town (like the [[Witchlight Carnival|carnival]]) so that they can distract from him doing these illegal trades as well as maintaining favour with the majority of the population. [[Gellan Primewater|Primewater]] was in on the smuggling operation conducted at the haunted house and so when [[The Party|OMAM]] busted it he wasn’t particularly happy and so probably doesn’t like us very much. Winston goes on to state that the majority of the trades occur with clients in the fringes of the [[Dreadwood]]/[[Hool Marshes|marshes]].

Info on [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] - [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] doesn’t like smuggling and the [[Sea Princes]] and a large portion of this is feeling is attributed to [[Skerrin Wavechaser|Skerrin]] (Anders’ butler) reinforcing the idea to oppose this. [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] is the final council member and hasn’t decided his allegiance to either the [[Traditionalists]] or the [[Loyalists]]. [[Skerrin Wavechaser|Skerrin]] is pushing [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] to be more of a [[Loyalist]] as this fits with the idea of being against smuggling and the [[Sea Princes]]. Note that Anders’ mother ([[Petra Solmor|Petra]]) died in apparently uncertain terms - there are rumours that foul play is involved with her death (Need to use this info to potentially get [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] on side).

#### Winstons Ledger

Many clients are detailed numerically in the ledger, however the key detail picked up on was the fact that there is to be an other meeting at [[Winston]]'s Store in 8 days time with [[Client number 4]] at 10pm. [[Client number 4]] also had a meeting with [[Winston]] when we broke into his basement and has been described as draconic in nature. It is unlikely that the meeting in 8 days time will go ahead as [[Winston]] has likely fled [[Saltmarsh]], but it’s something we should try and remember.

#### Scrying on Primewater

Next slave trade to come with the next delivery of either Lumber or Textiles. This info is likely corroborated in what’s assumed to be [[Gellan Primewater|Primewater]]’s ledger which he has hidden in a secret vault behind a painting of a ship in the office in his house which appears to be magically opened and closed by whispering the word ‘[[Morrigan]]’.

#### Plan to take down Primewater

We need to somehow get [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] on side to become a [[Traditionalists|Traditionalist]] as this will keep the balance within the town council between the [[Loyalists]] and the [[Traditionalists]] and will hopefully stop a civil war from occurring when we’re able to expose [[Gellan Primewater|Primewater]]. Following trying to persuade [[Anders Solmor|Anders]] to have more traditionalist ideologies, we need to investigate Primewaters house and gain access to his office so that we can look through his assumed ledger and see if there’s any more information about future trades. If we get this info, we can take this to [[Eliander Fireborn|Eliander]] and try to convince him to prepare a sting operation with us aiming to catch [[Gellan Primewater|Primewater]] red handed.

#### Property in Saltmarsh

The party visited the council building and enquired with a very bored looking woman called Floris who said she'd look into an estimate for you to build a residence, but in order to buy property you need to have contributed to Saltmarsh in some way. THe party identified area 24 on the map as being of interest. This is near to the location known as [[Crabbers Cove]]. [[Gareth]] stated that [[Barnacle Bess]] was a very good ship hand and mentioned that [[Barnacle Bess|Bess]] could have something to do with [[Crabbers Cove]] further up the dock (Not sure, but worth checking out)? Apparently it is a warehouse that is full to the brim with crabs - We could take [[Barnacle Bess|Bess]] with us and see if there are other crabs like her?

#### Xendros Shop

The party spoke to Xendros about the notice she had put on the board about the "Apparatus of Kwalish". SHe was disappointed you had not come with news but expressed that she and the nation she comes from would be very interested in acquiring the item were you to 
[[Auberon]] paid 1650gp to have a magic rapier (and any potential change) delivered to him when [[Xendros]] locates one. Unsure on everyone else’s purchases…


#### Minor
- Manistrad mentioned she had a job available to track down a thief who stole a shipment of expensive mining gear. You recovered and deposited an arms cache with the town Guard.
- [[Auberon]] made friends with the psuedodragon [[Bimz]], convincing him to leave his accrued hoard of scrolls and books and come with the party. [[Bimz]] has currently been left in a room at the Snapping Line with two books for entertainment: the ledger for the pub, and "The Lusty Argonian Maid" which was found under a bed in one of the rooms of the pub.
