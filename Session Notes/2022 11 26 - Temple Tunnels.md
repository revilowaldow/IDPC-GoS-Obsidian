## Session Summary:

You chased after Winston down the tunnel, leaving Eliander behind. 
After initially catching up with Winston half of you dealt with the bearing golem he summoned, by stuffing it in a bag of holding.

You caught Winston and after several attempts, bound him.

Winston bartered with you for his freedom in exchange for the following information.


### Loyalists


## Dan C's Notes

#### Winston Interrogation

The Saltmarsh council are split into two factions, the Loyalists and the Traditionalists. The Loyalists are typically loyal to the overall kingdom and are trying to ‘improve’ Saltmarsh (like they did with Seaton). However, this often means losing all sense of personality of a town/city. Taking Seaton as an example, the city is successful and a strong naval stronghold, but is devoid of meaningful life. The Loyalists also have good relationships with the dwarves and mines as they need the mines to be a success - Loyalists include: Eliander, Copperlocks

Traditionalists are more interested in the personality and trade of the city and so will let smuggling go for the ‘good’ of the community (as well as being able to satiate whatever their level of greed may be). The idea being that a small amount of smuggling enhances the trade of the town and therefore the QOL of the community. It also entices a variety of personalities into the town to conduct business and so makes for a more interesting, vibrant place to inhabit. - Traditionalists include: Eda, Primewater

Winston states that Primewater is essentially the head of the entire smuggling organisation within Saltmarsh as well as being a slaver. This is purely driven by his greed. He’s known to pay for lavish events for the town (like the carnival) so that they can distract from him doing these illegal trades as well as maintaining favour with the majority of the population. Primewater was in on the smuggling operation conducted at the haunted house and so when OMAM busted it he wasn’t particularly happy and so probably doesn’t like us very much. Winston goes on to state that the majority of the trades occur with clients in the fringes of the dreadwood/marshes.

Info on Anders - Anders doesn’t like smuggling and the Sea Princes and a large portion of this is feeling is attributed to Skellen (Anders’ butler) reinforcing the idea to oppose this. Anders is the final council member and hasn’t decided his allegiance to either the Traditionalists or the Loyalists. Skellen is pushing Anders to be more of a Loyalist as this fits with the idea of being against smuggling and the Sea Princes. Note that Anders’ mother died in apparently uncertain terms - there are rumours that foul play is involved with her death (Need to use this info to potentially get Anders on side).

#### Winstons Ledger

Many clients are detailed numerically in the ledger, however the key detail picked up on was the fact that there is to be an other meeting at Winston Store in 8 days time with client number 4 at 10pm. Client number 4 also had a meeting with Winston when we broke into his basement and has been described as draconic in nature. It is unlikely that the meeting in 8 days time will go ahead as Winston has likely fled Saltmarsh, but it’s something we should try and remember.

#### Scrying on Primewater

Next slave trade to come with the next delivery of either Lumber or Textiles. This info is likely corroborated in what’s assumed to be Primewater’s ledger which he has hidden in a secret vault behind a painting of a ship in the office in his house which appears to be magically opened and closed by whispering the word ‘Morrigan’.

#### Plan to take down Primewater

We need to somehow get Anders on side to become a Traditionalist as this will keep the balance within the town council between the loyalists and the traditionalists and will hopefully stop a civil war from occurring when we’re able to expose Primewater. Following trying to persuade Anders to have more traditionalist ideologies, we need to investigate Primewaters house and gain access to his office so that we can look through his assumed ledger and see if there’s any more information about future trades. If we get this info, we can take this to Eliander and try to convince him to prepare a sting operation with us aiming to catch Primewater red handed.

#### Crabbers Cove

Gareth stated that Bess was a very good ship hand and mentioned that Bess could have something to do with crabbers cove further up the dock (Not sure, but worth checking out)? Apparently it is a warehouse that is full to the brim with crabs - We could take Bess with us and see if there are other crabs like her?

#### Xendros Shop

Auberon paid 1650gp to have a magic rapier (and any potential change) delivered to him when Xendros locates one. Unsure on everyone else’s purchases…
