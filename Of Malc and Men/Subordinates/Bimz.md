Bimz is a pseudo dragon who was previously found in the company of [[Lizardfolk]] aboard the [[Sea Ghost]] when it was boarded by [[The Party]].

He was apprehended along with the [[Lizardfolk]] but escaped while they were being held in [[Hoolwatch Tower]]

He made his way beneath the [[Temple of Procan]], where he was discovered by [[Auberon]] having made a hoard and bed of scrolls and books. [[Auberon]] temped him to follow them with a mixture of food and lore.

[[Auberon]] left Bimz in a room in [[The Snapping Line]] with two books; The Ledger of buisness for the pub, and The Lusty Argonian Maid.
